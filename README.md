# FabLabGatekeepers

 For three weeks, we were the gatekeepers of Ashesi's Fab Lab. We spent day and night, trying to make our robots work for the GRC'24 Competition. We did chalk some successes, and some failures as well. 
 I was mainly in charge of the sensing and integration of the code. Here you will find everything we ever tried, codewise.

 Team: Owureku, Jed, Jude, Emmanuel Awuah, Joel Haizel, Ben Charles and myself :-).

 The challenge was to program the Holeybot to be able to achieve both remote and manual control to transport 'waterballs' into their destinations.


 _This project was done in August 2024._
